# React - The Complete Guide - My Journey!

## About This Repository

This is simply a place where I maintain all the projects I have created throughout Max's Udemy course

## Progress So Far

As I am taking multiple React courses at once, I have a rather conservative goal of completing Max's course by the end September
8/12/21: As of my initial commit, I have 264/490 completed
8/13/21: 284/490 lessons completed
(Taking break to focus on pure HTML/CSS/JS front-end skills)
11/02/21: Starting course again! 311/491 lesson completed!

## The Future Of This Project

Upon completing the course, I hope to improve upon each and every project. I hope to also improve upon the concept of each and putting a unique spin on them.
